# COSC 4368 w/Eick

Eick Assignment 1: Using RL

## Instructions

This project uses Makefile. **ALWAYS look at files you plan on running on your machine.**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sebvu/eick-pd-world.git (or ssh, doesn't matter)
cd ./eick-pd-world
make
cd ./bin
./exec-main
```

If you are using clangd LSP or some other LSP that's heuristics rely on a compile_commands.json, use `bear` and run the following command.

```sh
bear -- make
```
